# Virtues

The 4th bottom-nav tab (`app/(app)/virtues/page.tsx` → `components/ReviewView.tsx`) — a weekly-rotating virtue from whichever **Philosophy** (virtue set) the user has selected, a daily yes/no check-in across that philosophy's virtues, and a Sunday weekly-review summary. The component is still internally named `ReviewView` — "Review" was the tab's original name (per `CLAUDE.md`'s brief) before it was consolidated into "Virtues" at the nav/URL level; see "The `/review` redirect" below.

Virtues are no longer a single hardcoded 13-item list. A **Philosophy** is an admin-created, named virtue set (e.g. "A Good Man," "Franklin's 13 Virtues"); each user picks one as their active focus via a marketplace on the Virtues page. Everything that used to assume "13 virtues, one global set" — rotation math, check-in validation, weekly review, detail pages — now reads the count and contents of whichever philosophy is currently selected.

## Data model

**`Philosophy`** (`models/Philosophy.ts`, collection `philosophies`):
```ts
{ name, slug (unique), description, isSystem: boolean (default false), isActive: boolean (default true), order: number (default 0), createdAt, updatedAt }
```
No stored virtue count — every read that needs one computes `Virtue.countDocuments({ philosophyId, isActive: true })` (or the aggregate equivalent for a list) fresh, so it can never drift out of sync with the actual virtue documents. `isSystem: true` marks the two admin-seeded philosophies ("A Good Man," slug `agm`; "Franklin's 13 Virtues," slug `franklin-13`) — it has no enforcement effect in code beyond a "System" badge in the management UI; system philosophies can still be edited/deactivated by an admin like any other.

**`Virtue`** (`models/Virtue.ts`, collection `virtues`) — one document per virtue, now scoped to a philosophy:
```ts
{ philosophyId (ref Philosophy, required), name, slug (globally unique), tagline, displayName, order: number, essay: string (default ""), etymology: string (default ""), isActive: boolean (default true) }
```
`order` is 1..N **within its philosophy**, not a global 1–13 — it drives the rotation math below, scoped per philosophy. `slug` is still **globally** unique across every philosophy (a deliberate simplicity choice, not a bug) — `/virtues/[slug]` looks up a virtue by slug alone with no philosophy in the URL, so two philosophies can't both use the same slug for a same-named virtue; duplicating a philosophy (see below) auto-disambiguates copied slugs for exactly this reason.

**`VirtueCheckIn`** (`models/VirtueCheckIn.ts`, collection `virtuecheckins`) — one document per user per **day** (not per virtue):
```ts
{ userId, philosophyId (ref Philosophy, required), date: string, weekStartDate: string, answers: [{ virtueId, virtueName, answer: "yes" | "no" }], createdAt }
```
`philosophyId` is stamped server-side at write time from the user's *current* `User.selectedPhilosophyId` — never trusted from the client, and never migrated retroactively if the user later switches philosophies. This means a user's check-in history stays correctly attributed to whichever philosophy was active on each historical day, and every read (`GET /api/virtue-checkins`, all three query modes) is scoped by `philosophyId` too, so switching philosophies never mixes one philosophy's history into another's summary. A unique compound index on `{ userId, date }` still means the whole day's answers live in one document's `answers` array, not one row per virtue.

**`User`** (`models/User.ts`) — adds `selectedPhilosophyId: ObjectId | null (ref Philosophy, default null)` and `virtueStackStartWeek: string | null` (Monday, `YYYY-MM-DD`) alongside the pre-existing `apiKey` and `virtueWalkthroughSeen` fields. `selectedPhilosophyId: null` means the user hasn't picked a philosophy yet (every brand-new user, and every pre-existing user before the one-time migration below ran) — the Virtues page renders the marketplace instead of the normal check-in UI in that state. `virtueStackStartWeek` drives progressive virtue stacking — see below.

## Progressive virtue stacking

A brand-new user's first check-in shouldn't be N yes/no questions on virtues they haven't read about yet. Each user's daily check-in list only includes virtues up to how many weeks they've *personally* been active on their current philosophy — capped at, and cyclically wrapping around, that philosophy's total virtue count. This is entirely separate from, and never changes, the shared calendar-driven "this week's virtue" highlight (`currentVirtueOrder`, above) — every user sees the identical highlight regardless of their personal stack size; stacking only controls how many *additional* virtues ride along in a given user's own check-in list.

**Data model**: `User.virtueStackStartWeek` — the Monday (`weekStartDate`-formatted) of the week a user's personal stacking epoch began: on first use, on an explicit Virtue Reset, or on a philosophy switch. `null` (never set, e.g. every pre-existing user before this feature shipped) is lazily initialized to the *current* week on first read — functionally identical to a brand-new signup, per `lib/philosophy.ts`'s `resolveVirtueStackStartWeek(userId)`.

**Math** (`lib/virtue-dates.ts`, pure, stateless given the start-week anchor — no cron job, nothing incremented on a schedule):
- `personalWeeksActive(startWeekMonday, date)` — weeks elapsed (1-indexed, min 1) between the anchor and `date`, both Monday-anchored via `weekStartDate` — advances by exactly 1 every time the shared rotation's own week boundary is crossed, with nothing stored beyond the anchor itself.
- `personalStackSize(weeksActive, virtueCount) = ((weeksActive - 1) % virtueCount) + 1` — cycles 1..virtueCount and wraps back to 1, deliberately mirroring `currentVirtueOrder`'s own formula.
- `personalStackOrders(currentOrder, stackSize, virtueCount)` — the `stackSize` virtues (as `order` values) belonging in the list: `currentOrder` (this week's *live* shared highlight — must be freshly recomputed per call, not the user's original start-week highlight, since the shared highlight itself keeps advancing week over week) and walking backward through the fixed order, wrapping the same way the shared rotation wraps. Concretely this reproduces "every shared highlight the user has seen since their stacking epoch began."

**Wiring**: `GET /api/virtue-stack` (`app/api/virtue-stack/route.ts`) resolves the caller's `stackSize` server-side (`{ stackSize: number | null }`, `null` when no philosophy selected) and is the only new endpoint — everything downstream (history dots, weekly review tallies, per-virtue effectiveness %) already tolerates a virtue having no answer on a given day (renders as an empty/`null` dot), so virtues outside a user's stack on a given day needed no other backend changes. `components/VirtueCheckInModal.tsx` fetches this alongside the existing `GET /api/virtues` call and filters the rendered/submitted virtue list down to `personalStackOrders(thisWeekVirtue.order, stackSize, allVirtues.length)` — `thisWeekVirtue` is the same shared-highlight object both mounting call sites (`RoutinesView.tsx`'s inline check-in, `ReviewView.tsx`'s "Today's Check-in") already pass down, so no prop plumbing changed at either call site. Falls back to showing every virtue if stack info isn't available, rather than blocking check-in.

**Reset**: `PATCH /api/user/profile` accepts `{ resetVirtueStack: true }`, setting `virtueStackStartWeek` to the current week — the user's list immediately drops to just that week's shared highlight. Exposed as a "Reset Virtue Progress" button in `PhilosophyManageSheet.tsx`'s sheet variant only (not the forced-onboarding inline marketplace, since there's no progress yet to reset), behind a native `confirm()` (matching this codebase's existing confirm-dialog convention, e.g. `GoalDetailView.tsx`'s milestone delete) — `ReviewView.tsx`'s `resetVirtueStack` callback PATCHes and `router.refresh()`s.

**Philosophy switch**: `PATCH /api/user/profile` unconditionally resets `virtueStackStartWeek` to the current week any time `selectedPhilosophyId` is set to a non-null value — first pick and later switches alike, since a fresh philosophy has no meaningful stack mapping from the old one. This is a route-level invariant, not a client-sent flag. `PhilosophyManageSheet.tsx`'s card tap handler shows the same `confirm()` pattern *before* calling `onSelect` whenever `currentPhilosophyId` is already set and differs from the tapped card (i.e., an actual switch, not the initial marketplace pick or a re-tap of the already-selected card, which is a no-op).

**Known follow-up, not solved here**: `WeeklyReviewModal.tsx`'s Sunday summary still tallies every virtue in the philosophy, not just the ones that were actually in a user's stack that week — a virtue outside the stack simply shows 0/7 rather than being excluded from the summary entirely.

**Admin** is centralized in `lib/admin.ts`'s `isAdmin(email)` (hardcoded email check + `SKIP_AUTH` fallback) — every admin-gated route and page imports this one helper now, rather than duplicating the check. **`models/User.ts` still has no `role` field** — `CLAUDE.md`'s "Admin Role" section implying a stored `role: 'admin'` remains aspirational, not implemented.

**Quotes are built, contrary to `CLAUDE.md`'s "NOT BUILT (Phase 4)" note** — `models/Quote.ts` exists, along with a full admin authoring UI and two read paths (loading-screen virtue-pinned pick, nav-button fully random pick). Not part of this feature's own data model (no `Virtue`/`Philosophy` field references a `Quote`, beyond the loose `virtue: slug` string match used for the loading-screen pin) — see [api/quotes-api.md](../api/quotes-api.md) for the full surface.

## Week convention and rotation (`lib/virtue-dates.ts`)

- `isoWeekNumber(date)` — standard ISO-8601 week number.
- `weekStartDate(date)` — the **Monday** of that ISO week, `YYYY-MM-DD`. Deliberately different from `StreakDots`/Analytics' Sunday-anchored `calendarWeekDates` — see [routines.md](routines.md#weekly-schedule--success-threshold).
- `currentVirtueOrder(date, virtueCount) = virtueCount > 0 ? ((isoWeekNumber(date) - 1) % virtueCount) + 1 : 1` — **fully deterministic and stateless**, generalized from a hardcoded `% 13`. Every caller resolves "how many active virtues does the selected philosophy have" (a `countDocuments`) before calling this — there is no default `virtueCount`, so no caller can silently keep assuming 13. Switching philosophies mid-cycle just means the next call passes a different count; nothing needs to be reset or migrated.
- The server reads "today" as `new Date().toISOString()` (UTC) when loading `/virtues` — the same class of UTC-vs-local-day edge case flagged elsewhere in this app's docs (matters only right around midnight in timezones behind UTC).

## Philosophy marketplace and switching

`app/(app)/virtues/page.tsx` resolves the caller's `User.selectedPhilosophyId` server-side via `lib/philosophy.ts`'s `resolveSelectedPhilosophyId(userId)` before rendering anything else.

- **`null`** (no philosophy selected) → `ReviewView.tsx` renders `PhilosophyMarketplaceInline` (from `components/PhilosophyManageSheet.tsx`) in place of the normal check-in/history UI — a card per active `Philosophy` (name, description, computed virtue count); tapping one `PATCH`es `/api/user/profile` with `{ selectedPhilosophyId }` and reloads into the normal Virtues page for it.
- **set** → the normal check-in/history UI renders as before, scoped to that philosophy's virtues and check-in history.

A **"Manage"** button sits next to the "This Week's Virtue" banner at all times (regardless of whether a philosophy is currently selected) and opens `PhilosophyManageSheet` — the same card grid as an overlay, for switching later. Admins additionally see, on every card: **Virtues** (drills into that philosophy's virtue list — add, drag-reorder via `@dnd-kit` reusing the pattern from `RoutineEditView.tsx`, inline edit exposing word/slug/display name/sentence-description/paragraph-description/etymology, soft-delete via `isActive: false`), **Duplicate** (deep-copies the philosophy's active virtues into a new one — fresh `_id`s, disambiguated slugs, not references), and **Deactivate/Activate**. **Editing a virtue's word or slug from this form doesn't actually persist** — `PATCH /api/virtues/[id]`'s field allowlist only accepts `displayName`/`tagline`/`essay`/`etymology`/`order`/`isActive`, so `name`/`slug` edits update the row's local state optimistically but silently drop on the next reload (see [api/virtues-api.md](../api/virtues-api.md#patch-apivirtuesid)). A **"+ New Philosophy"** control (admin-only) creates an empty philosophy to add virtues to. The sheet is rendered wider than the app's usual 420px mobile shell (`sm:max-w-2xl`) — comfortable for authoring virtue text on desktop, still usable stacked on mobile.

`lib/philosophy.ts`'s `resolveSelectedPhilosophyId` goes through the raw Mongo driver collection (`User.collection.findOne`), not the Mongoose model, specifically so it also works for `SKIP_AUTH`'s `dev-local-user` — that id isn't a valid ObjectId, so a Mongoose `findById`/`findByIdAndUpdate` throws a CastError before ever reaching the database (the same issue `getOrCreateApiKey` in `lib/api-key.ts` solves for API keys). `PATCH /api/user/profile` does the same for writes, so the marketplace/switching flow is fully exercisable locally under `SKIP_AUTH=true`, with a real, persisted (not in-memory) `dev-local-user` document.

## Daily check-in

Three entry points, all mounting the same `components/VirtueCheckInModal.tsx`:
1. **Inline from the Routines page** — tapping the "Virtue Check-in" special `RoutineItem` (`itemType: "virtue_checkin"`, see [routines.md](routines.md#item-types)) sets local state in `RoutinesView.tsx` and opens the modal without navigating away.
2. **Inside a Routine Session** — reaching that same item during "Start Routine" (`RoutineSession.tsx`'s special-item handoff).
3. **From `/virtues` directly** — the "Today's Check-in" button in `ReviewView.tsx`.

**This week's focus, at the top.** Above the YES/NO list, the modal shows a compact reminder of the week's focus virtue (`components/VirtueSummary.tsx`): `displayName`, `tagline`, and the `essay` behind a collapsed-by-default "Read more". It's part of the scroll area, so the user scrolls straight down into the rows. The modal **resolves the focus virtue itself** as `currentVirtueOrder(date, virtues.length)` over its own `GET /api/virtues` result (the selected philosophy's active virtues, which already include `tagline`/`essay`/`displayName`), rather than trusting the `thisWeekVirtue` prop. That way the three callers can't drift, and a yesterday check-in across a Monday boundary shows the virtue that day belonged to. The prop is now only a pre-load fallback. The same derived order also anchors progressive stacking (`personalStackOrders`), so the focus card and the stacked list always agree. Previously stacking used the prop's server-computed "today" order. An empty tagline or essay hides that part rather than rendering an empty block. The header now shows "Daily Check-in" plus the date being checked in, since the virtue name moved into the card.

The modal fetches the *selected philosophy's* active virtues (`GET /api/virtues`, scoped server-side to `User.selectedPhilosophyId`) and shows one YES/NO row per virtue — every virtue in the philosophy, every day, not just this week's, matching Franklin's "track all daily, focus on one" framing. Every virtue must be answered before Submit enables (`answeredCount === virtues.length` — already dynamic, not hardcoded, so it needed no change for this feature). `POST /api/virtue-checkins` resolves the caller's `philosophyId` server-side, `400`s if they somehow have none selected (defense-in-depth — the UI can't reach this state), and upserts the day's document with `philosophyId` stamped in.

**Honesty rules are thinner than `CLAUDE.md` describes.** The route's only real date validation is a loose UTC-band check — the submitted date must fall within roughly a day on either side of "now," chosen to cover any timezone's local "today/yesterday" without the server knowing the user's offset. `CLAUDE.md`'s other two claimed rules — "no editing past answers once submitted" and "locked after Sunday midnight" — **are not enforced anywhere in code**. The write is an unconditional upsert (now also unconditionally re-stamping `philosophyId` to whatever's currently selected), so re-`POST`ing for an already-answered date silently overwrites it. `ReviewView.tsx` disables its own check-in button once today's document already exists, but that's a client convenience, not a server-side lock; a direct `POST` would still succeed.

Completing the modal calls `POST /api/routine-logs` for the `virtue_checkin` item with a **hardcoded `actualMinutes: 5`** — not derived from any timer, unlike every other timed item in the app.

## Weekly review

Triggered from `RoutinesView.tsx`'s "Weekly Review" special `RoutineItem` (`itemType: "weekly_review"`), which navigates to `/virtues?mode=weekly`, from the "Start This Week's Review" button on `/virtues` (both open `components/WeeklyReviewModal.tsx` inside `ReviewView`), or from reaching that item inside a Routine Session, where `RoutineSession.tsx` mounts the modal directly.

**Sunday-only gating is client-UI-only, in exactly one place**: `ReviewView.tsx` computes `isSunday` from the server-passed (UTC) date and disables the button on other days. `WeeklyReviewModal.tsx` itself has a prop comment claiming its `date` "must be Sunday" but enforces nothing — it renders for whatever date it's given. Nothing server-side checks day-of-week at all.

Content is a **three-step sequence**, one page at a time inside the same bottom sheet. Each step has a single primary button (Enter does the same), plus a ‹ back button and step dots in the header:

1. **Recap: "This past week's focus."** The virtue of the ISO week containing `date`. Weeks are Monday-anchored, so on Sunday that's the week that's ending: `currentVirtueOrder(date, count)`. Shown with `VirtueSummary` (`displayName`, `tagline`, essay behind "Read more"). A lightweight intro, not a gate: "See how you did" moves on.
2. **Results.** `GET /api/virtue-checkins?weekStart=...` (scoped to the selected philosophy) for that week, tallied yes/total per virtue client-side, then a strongest/needs-work pair and a full per-virtue score bar (a separate local 3-band color scale — `≥70% olive / ≥40% amber / else burgundy` — not `lib/routine-progress.ts`'s pacing math). With zero check-ins it shows "No check-ins recorded this week." and the other two steps still render normally. Previously, zero check-ins also hid the next-week teaser.
3. **Reveal: next week's focus.** Order `((nextWeekNum - 1) % count) + 1`, the existing calculation kept as-is, again with full `VirtueSummary` content, replacing the old name/tagline/etymology teaser. In a one-virtue philosophy, current and next are the same virtue, and the eyebrow reads "Next week — the same focus continues." **"Got it. Start next week."** here is what logs the item: `POST /api/routine-logs` for `weekly_review` with a **hardcoded `actualMinutes: 10`**, same caveat as the daily check-in.

**Where the virtue objects come from:** the modal fetches `GET /api/virtues` once (the selected philosophy's active virtues, already including `tagline`/`essay`/`displayName`, so no API change was needed) and picks both the recap and the reveal from it by order. The `currentVirtue` prop is only a fallback for the recap until that fetch lands. `count` is the `virtueCount` prop (required, threaded down from the page via `ReviewView` → `WeeklyReviewModal`, replacing the old hardcoded `% 13`), falling back to the fetched list's length when a caller passes `0`. `RoutineSession.tsx` can do that when its `thisWeekVirtue` is missing. An empty tagline or essay hides that part of the block. If no virtue matches an order, the reveal falls back to "Virtue #N begins Monday."

## Virtue detail — two separate, non-identical UIs

- **`components/VirtueDetailView.tsx`** — the full page at `/virtues/[slug]`. Shows an order badge (`{order} / {virtueCount}`, both server-resolved for that virtue's own philosophy — the old hardcoded `/ 12` bug is fixed), a "This Week" pill, displayName, tagline, and **both etymology and essay, admin-editable inline** (gated by `isAdmin`). The "This Week" pill only shows when the viewed virtue's `philosophyId` **also** matches the viewer's currently-selected philosophy — otherwise browsing to a different philosophy's virtue at the same `order` via a direct link would incorrectly show it as current.
- **`components/VirtueSheet.tsx`** — a bottom sheet opened from the Routines page (tapping the "This Week's Virtue" banner, no navigation). Shows order ("Week X of N," `N` now a real per-philosophy count passed down as `virtue.virtueCount`, not hardcoded 13), displayName, tagline, and **essay only** — no etymology shown or editable at all.

These are independently maintained with real feature drift between them (only the full page supports etymology editing) — a change to one's editing UX doesn't propagate to the other.

## `/virtues` page structure (`ReviewView.tsx`)

This-week banner (links to the slug page) + Manage button → `VirtuesHowItWorks` info-icon walkthrough trigger (auto-opens once via `User.virtueWalkthroughSeen`) → "Today's Check-in" button → "Start This Week's Review" button (Sunday-gated per above) → a 7-day/30-day toggle → a summary (overall %, days checked in, strongest/needs-work virtue) → one row per virtue with a mini history dot-strip, each linking to `/virtues/[slug]`. When no philosophy is selected, everything after the Manage button is replaced by the marketplace (see above).

## The `/review` redirect

`app/(app)/review/page.tsx` is a one-shot server redirect — forwards `mode`/`date`/`return` query params and 307s to `/virtues` (Next.js's `redirect()` default status). `BottomNav.tsx`'s nav tabs (`RIGHT_TABS`) point at `/virtues`, not `/review` — this isn't a bug or an unfinished feature, it's a compatibility shim left behind after "Review" was consolidated into "Virtues" at the URL level, kept so any old bookmarked/shared `/review` links still land somewhere.

## Onboarding walkthrough

`components/VirtuesHowItWorks.tsx` — an info-icon button opening `components/VirtueWalkthroughModal.tsx`, plus `autoOpen` support (opens itself once, shortly after mount, driven by `!User.virtueWalkthroughSeen`). The modal is a static 4-section explainer (Where This Comes From / How It Works / Yes or No / The Sunday Review); dismissing it any way (backdrop, X, "Got It") `PATCH`es `/api/user/profile` with `{ virtueWalkthroughSeen: true }` first. The root-level `virtue-system-app-medium.md` is the literal source text this copy was pulled from — not a stale planning doc, it's still verbatim in sync with the shipped modal. It predates the Philosophy feature and still describes the old single-list framing; not updated as part of this change since it isn't shipped UI, just source prose.

## Auto-provisioning

`ensureVirtueCheckInItems(userId)` (`lib/seed.ts`) is idempotent (bails if a `virtue_checkin` or `weekly_review` item already exists for the user) and requires an existing evening `RoutineGroup` (bails silently if none). It appends two `RoutineItem`s to the end of that group: `{ name: "Virtue Check-in", icon: "compass", projectedMinutes: 5, itemType: "virtue_checkin" }` and `{ name: "Weekly Review", icon: "shield", projectedMinutes: 10, itemType: "weekly_review" }` — matching the hardcoded `actualMinutes` values completing them logs, above. Called from `app/(app)/routines/page.tsx` alongside the app's other per-user seed functions, on every page load. This only seeds the two special *items* — the `Virtue`/`Philosophy` reference documents themselves are seeded separately, once, by the migration script below.

## One-time migration (`scripts/migrate-philosophies.mjs`)

Run manually, exactly once per environment (`node --env-file=.env.local scripts/migrate-philosophies.mjs`), **not** wired into app boot — unlike the `ensure*()` per-user seed functions above (safe to re-run on every page load because they only add missing per-user defaults), re-running this as an ongoing rule would silently default every brand-new user to "A Good Man" and they'd never see the marketplace. Idempotent in the sense that it's safe to *re-run* if interrupted (every step checks "has this already been done" first), but never invoked from application code. Steps: creates the "A Good Man" `Philosophy` (`isSystem: true`, slug `agm`) for the pre-existing hand-inserted 13 virtues if it doesn't exist yet; backfills `philosophyId` onto every `Virtue`/`VirtueCheckIn` document missing it; backfills `selectedPhilosophyId` onto every `User` document where it's unset; seeds Benjamin Franklin's own 13 virtues (his short precepts, public domain, from his autobiography) as a second `isSystem: true` Philosophy (slug `franklin-13`), so the marketplace has a real second option out of the box.

## Files

- `models/Philosophy.ts` — admin-created virtue sets (marketplace entries).
- `models/Virtue.ts` — virtue reference documents, scoped to a philosophy via `philosophyId`.
- `models/VirtueCheckIn.ts` — one document per user per day, stamped with the philosophy active at write time.
- `lib/virtue-dates.ts` — `isoWeekNumber`, `weekStartDate` (Monday-anchored), `currentVirtueOrder(date, virtueCount)` (stateless, per-philosophy rotation), and `personalWeeksActive`/`personalStackSize`/`personalStackOrders` (stateless progressive-stacking math, see above).
- `lib/seed-virtues.ts` — re-exports all six of the above; seeds nothing despite the name.
- `lib/philosophy.ts` — `resolveSelectedPhilosophyId(userId)`, shared by every page/route that needs the caller's active philosophy, and `resolveVirtueStackStartWeek(userId)` (lazy-inits on first read); raw-collection reads/writes so both also work for `dev-local-user`.
- `app/api/virtue-stack/route.ts` — `GET`, resolves the caller's current `stackSize` server-side; the only new API surface this feature added.
- `lib/admin.ts` — shared `isAdmin(email)` check, used by every admin-gated philosophy/virtue route and page.
- `lib/seed.ts`'s `ensureVirtueCheckInItems` — per-user idempotent seeding of the two special evening `RoutineItem`s.
- `scripts/migrate-philosophies.mjs` — one-off migration + Franklin's-13 seed (see above).
- `app/(app)/virtues/page.tsx` → `components/ReviewView.tsx` — the 4th nav tab; renders the marketplace or the normal UI depending on `User.selectedPhilosophyId`.
- `app/(app)/virtues/[slug]/page.tsx` → `components/VirtueDetailView.tsx` — full-page detail, admin essay+etymology editing, philosophy-aware "This Week" pill.
- `app/(app)/review/page.tsx` — dead-URL redirect shim to `/virtues`.
- `components/VirtueSheet.tsx` — the other virtue-detail UI (bottom sheet from the Routines page), essay-only.
- `components/VirtueCheckInModal.tsx` — the daily check-in modal; resolves this week's focus virtue from `date` + `GET /api/virtues` and shows it at the top, then filters the list down to the caller's personal stack via `GET /api/virtue-stack` + `personalStackOrders`.
- `components/WeeklyReviewModal.tsx` — the Sunday review modal: recap → results → next-week reveal (client-gated only; `virtueCount` a required prop; still tallies every philosophy virtue, not just the caller's stack — see "Known follow-up" above).
- `components/VirtueSummary.tsx` — shared read-only virtue reminder (`displayName`, `tagline`, collapsible `essay`) used by both modals above; separate from `VirtueSheet`/`VirtueDetailView`, which keep their own (editable) essay displays.
- `components/PhilosophyManageSheet.tsx` — the marketplace grid (`PhilosophyMarketplaceInline`, used inline when no philosophy is selected) and the "Manage" overlay sheet (default export), including the admin virtue editor, the switch-confirmation `confirm()`, and the "Reset Virtue Progress" button (sheet variant only).
- `components/VirtuesHowItWorks.tsx` / `components/VirtueWalkthroughModal.tsx` — onboarding explainer, content sourced from `virtue-system-app-medium.md`.
