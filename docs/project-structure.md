# Project Structure

**be-one** ("A Good Man") is a Next.js 14 App Router application written in TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel — Next.js API routes act as the backend (serverless functions), with MongoDB (via Mongoose) as the persistence layer. There is no separate backend service; `app/api/**/route.ts` files are the entire API surface. A native iOS shell (Capacitor, server-URL mode — see "iOS Native Shell" below) wraps this same deployed web app; it does not change or duplicate any of the above.

## Folder Map

| Folder | What lives here |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Next.js App Router: pages/layouts under `app/(app)/` and the top-level routes, plus every API route handler under `app/api/**/route.ts`. |
| `components/` | Shared React client components — page-level views (`RoutinesView.tsx`, `GoalsView.tsx`, …), bottom-sheet/modal flows (`AddHabitSheet.tsx`, `FABTaskSheet.tsx`, …), smaller presentational pieces (`HabitIcon.tsx`, `StreakDots.tsx`, …), and `NativeBootstrap.tsx` (Keychain API-key push for App Intents, see app-intents.md). |
| `lib/` | DB connection utilities (`mongoose.ts`, `mongodb-client.ts`), auth config (`auth.ts`, `auth.config.ts`) and the Credentials sign-up/sign-in server actions (`auth-actions.ts` — see "Authentication" below), idempotent seed/bootstrap logic (`seed.ts`, `seed-templates.ts`, `seed-virtues.ts`), and small shared helpers (`routine-visibility.ts` — despite the name, just one hardcoded rule, not a general recurrence system, see routines.md — `routine-progress.ts`, `routine-log-actions.ts`/`routine-session-actions.ts` — the single-active-timer sweep/pause logic and `RoutineSession` bookkeeping shared by the app's own routine-logs routes and the external API, see routines-api.md and timer.md — `routine-log-events.ts` — the client-side `ROUTINE_LOG_CHANGED_EVENT` the FAB and `RoutinesView`'s today list both listen for, alongside their own short-interval polling, see timer.md — `useRingDrag.ts`, `projected-finish.ts`, `routine-timeline.ts` — the timer ring's drag-to-set-time gesture and the live projected-finish/timeline math, see timer.md — `routine-review-timeline.ts`, `review-colors.ts` — the Goal/Actual avg/Proposed timeline math and per-item segment colors behind the Routine Review flow, see routine-review.md — `week-dates.ts`, `useTodoActions.ts`, `virtue-dates.ts`, `philosophy.ts` — resolves a user's selected `Philosophy`, works for `dev-local-user` too, see virtues.md — `admin.ts` — shared `isAdmin(email)` check — `api-key.ts` — external API key generation/lookup, see external-api.md — `habit-trigger.ts` — the shared start/complete case dispatch behind the external `trigger-habit` endpoint, see external-api.md). |
| `models/` | Mongoose schema/model definitions, one per MongoDB collection (`Goal.ts`, `HabitTemplate.ts`, `Philosophy.ts`, `Quote.ts` — see api/quotes-api.md — `RoutineGroup.ts`, `RoutineItem.ts`, `RoutineLog.ts`, `RoutineSession.ts`, `Todo.ts`, `User.ts`, `Virtue.ts`, `VirtueCheckIn.ts`, `AppIntentLink.ts` — see app-intents.md). |
| `public/` | Static assets served at the web root — app icons, the PWA `manifest.json`, and the service worker `sw.js`. |
| `scripts/` | One-off, manually-run migration/seed scripts — not wired into app boot. `migrate-philosophies.mjs` (see virtues.md), `migrate-quotes.mjs` (renames the pre-existing personal `quotes` collection's `{ quote, author, genre }` shape into the app's `Quote` shape — see api/quotes-api.md), `seed-stoicism-and-franklin-content.mjs` (seeds Stoic + Franklin virtue/philosophy content), and `_tmp-check-dev-user.mjs` (scratch debug script, not part of any workflow). |
| `types/` | Shared/ambient TypeScript declarations (currently `next-auth.d.ts`, extending the NextAuth session/user types). |
| `ios/` | Generated Xcode project for the native shell (Capacitor). `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` is the project to open — this Capacitor version uses Swift Package Manager, not CocoaPods, so there is no `.xcworkspace`. `ios/App/App/MainViewController.swift` registers the App Intents Keychain bridge plugin (`capacitorDidLoad`) and disables WebView scroll bounce; `ios/App/App/AppIntents/` holds the App Intents Swift code, see app-intents.md. `ios/DerivedData/` is Xcode build cache, gitignored. |
| `assets/` | Master 1024×1024 icon and splash source images (generated from the jackalope logo via `npx capacitor-assets generate`), consumed to produce `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/`. |
| `capacitor.config.ts` | Capacitor config at repo root — `server.url` points the native WebView at the deployed Vercel URL (server-URL mode: no static export, the native shell just loads the live site). `server.allowNavigation` allowlists `accounts.google.com` so Google OAuth completes inside the app's own WebView instead of Capacitor bouncing it out to system Safari, which would break Auth.js's CSRF/session cookie continuity — see "iOS Native Shell" below. |

## Authentication

Two sign-in paths, both via Auth.js (NextAuth v5), sharing one `users` collection (`models/User.ts`, `strict: false` so it can hold both the adapter-owned fields and app-specific ones):

- **Google OAuth** — `MongoDBAdapter` (in `lib/auth.ts`) creates the user record automatically on first sign-in and fires the `createUser` event, which calls `seedDefaultRoutines`. No `passwordHash` is ever set on these accounts.
- **Email/password (Credentials)** — added for App Store review parity. `lib/auth-actions.ts`'s `signUpAction` validates input, checks for a duplicate email, hashes the password with `bcryptjs` (12 rounds) onto `User.passwordHash`, calls `seedDefaultRoutines` itself (the adapter's `createUser` event never fires for a manually-inserted user), then signs in. The Credentials provider's `authorize()` (in `lib/auth.ts`, Node-only — needs bcrypt + Mongoose, neither Edge-safe) rejects any account with no `passwordHash`, so a password-login attempt can't authenticate into a Google-only account. `signInAction` handles existing-user credential sign-in the same way, catching `AuthError`/`CredentialsSignin` to return a friendly `{ error }` instead of throwing.
- **Changing password** — `PATCH /api/user/password` (profile page's `ChangePasswordForm.tsx`), requires the correct current password and only works on accounts that already have a `passwordHash`.
- **Deleting an account** — `DELETE /api/user/delete-account` (profile page's `DeleteAccountForm.tsx`), self-service in-app deletion added for App Store guideline 5.1.1(v) compliance. Password accounts must re-enter their current password; both account types must type a literal `DELETE` confirmation. The route purges every `userId`-scoped collection (`RoutineGroup`, `RoutineItem`, `RoutineLog`, `RoutineSession`, `Goal`, `Todo`, `VirtueCheckIn`, `AppIntentLink`, plus `HabitTemplate` by `createdBy`) — carefully excluding seed rows, which use `userId: null` / `createdBy: null` — then the adapter's raw `accounts`/`sessions` collections via `lib/mongodb-client.ts`'s `clientPromise`, then the `User` document itself, in that order so a mid-sequence failure leaves a still-usable account rather than an orphaned one. No DB transaction wraps this: Mongoose's `connectDB()` and the adapter's `clientPromise` are separate `MongoClient` connections that can't share one transaction session. On success the client signs out to `/login?deleted=1`.
- **`lib/auth.config.ts`** stays Google-only and stays Edge-safe — it's what `middleware.ts` imports (Edge runtime, no bcrypt/Mongoose). `lib/auth.ts` spreads it and overrides `providers` to add Credentials, since Credentials' `authorize()` only ever runs in the Node runtime (the API route handlers), never inside middleware, which just reads the session JWT.
- **`middleware.ts`** has two path sets: `PUBLIC_PAGE_PATHS` (`/login`, `/signup`) redirects a signed-in user away to `/routines`; `ALWAYS_ACCESSIBLE_PATHS` (`/privacy`) never redirects either direction, since the privacy policy has to work identically for a logged-out App Store reviewer and a logged-in user.

## iOS Native Shell

The iOS app is a Capacitor wrapper in **server-URL mode**: the native `WKWebView` loads the live production Next.js deployment directly (`capacitor.config.ts`'s `server.url`), the same as a browser tab, just without browser chrome and with its own icon/splash. There is no static export and no bundled frontend — the Next.js codebase requires zero changes for this to work, and any future edits to `app/`/`components/` ship to the iOS app automatically the next time production redeploys (no App Store review needed for content changes, only for native shell changes).

**Google OAuth inside the WebView:** Capacitor's default behavior sends navigation to domains outside the app's own origin (like `accounts.google.com`) out to the system Safari app. That breaks Auth.js's sign-in flow, because the CSRF token and session cookies set when the flow starts live in the app's WebView cookie jar, not Safari's — the callback lands back in Safari's separate jar and Auth.js can't validate it, surfacing as a generic `/api/auth/error` "Server error" page. The fix was to allowlist `accounts.google.com` in `capacitor.config.ts`'s `server.allowNavigation`, keeping the whole OAuth round-trip inside the app's own WebView and its single cookie jar. This did **not** require routing through `@capacitor/browser`/`ASWebAuthenticationSession` or Universal Links — the simpler in-WebView allowlist was sufficient once tested against the real production OAuth flow in the iOS Simulator.

**Branding:** `assets/icon.png` and `assets/splash.png`/`splash-dark.png` are generated once from the jackalope logo (parchment `#e8e0cc` background for the icon so the black line art is visible; the splash screen recolors the mark to parchment against the app's `#18160f` dark background) and then expanded into the full `Assets.xcassets` icon/splash set via `npx capacitor-assets generate --ios`. Re-run that command after editing the `assets/` masters, then `npx cap sync ios`.

**White flash between splash and content:** `WKWebView` defaults to a white canvas until the remote page's own CSS paints — a real, visible gap in server-URL mode since content loads over the network rather than instantly from a bundle. Fixed via `capacitor.config.ts`'s `ios.backgroundColor: '#18160f'` (Capacitor's official config for the WebView's own background, applied before any content loads) plus pinning the same color on `ios/App/App/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard`'s root view as a second guard against letterboxing. Verified by rapid-fire screenshotting through a cold launch, not just eyeballing it once.

**Native bootstrap:** `components/NativeBootstrap.tsx` (mounted in `app/layout.tsx`, `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`-guarded) pushes the user's API key into Keychain on every native cold start, via a custom `ApiKeyBridgePlugin` — the first custom native plugin in this project. This is what lets App Intents code (running independent of the WebView, possibly via a background launch) authenticate to the external API without ever touching React state. See app-intents.md.

### `app/` subfolders

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/(app)/` | The authenticated app shell — layout with the bottom nav, plus the `routines`, `goals`, `analytics`, `review`, `virtues`, `profile`, `store` pages. |
| `app/api/` | Every backend endpoint, grouped by domain (`routines`, `routine-items`, `routine-logs`, `routine-review`, `habits`, `habit-templates`, `goals`, `todos`, `philosophies`, `virtues`, `virtue-checkins`, `virtue-stack`, `quotes`, `analytics`, `user`, `external`, `auth`, `seed`, `dev`). `external` is API-key-authenticated (no session), for outside callers like the native App Intents "Trigger Habit" action — see `docs/api/external-api.md`. |
| `app/login/` | Public, unauthenticated page (per `middleware.ts`'s `PUBLIC_PAGE_PATHS`) — Google sign-in plus an email/password form (`SignInForm.tsx`). Honors a `?callbackUrl=` search param as the post-sign-in redirect, falling back to `/welcome`. |
| `app/signup/` | Public, unauthenticated page — email/password account creation (`SignUpForm.tsx`, `lib/auth-actions.ts`'s `signUpAction`). Same `?callbackUrl=` handling as `/login`. |
| `app/privacy/` | Privacy policy — always accessible regardless of auth state (per `middleware.ts`'s `ALWAYS_ACCESSIBLE_PATHS`), linked from both `/login` and `/signup`. |
| `app/welcome/` | Post-login splash screen, shown once per sign-in before landing on `/routines`. |

## Feature Docs

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`features/routines.md`](features/routines.md) | Time-of-day routine groups (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Custom), item states, back-entry, streaks, the per-item weekly schedule/success-threshold model, and the "Start Routine" sequential session. |

Todos has no separate API doc — its small surface (`/api/todos*`) is documented inline in [`features/todos.md`](features/todos.md), the same way `/api/analytics` is folded into `features/analytics.md` rather than split out. Quotes has no separate feature doc yet — its surface is documented directly in [`api/quotes-api.md`](api/quotes-api.md) instead.
