// weekly-progress math from the components that render it.

  // epoch) at which this item is expected to hit its own projectedMinutes
  // target, computed ONCE from its real start time (adjusted for any banked
  // pause time) — not re-derived from "now minus elapsed" on every tick.
  //
  // This matters: while the active item is still within its target, the
  // projected finish should be pinned to a fixed clock time and not visibly
  // move at all — you should only see it change if you finish early or run
  // over. Computing the active item's remaining time as "projectedMinutes -
  // elapsedSoFar" and adding that to a freshly-read "now" every render
  // happens to cancel out to the same fixed value algebraically, but it's
  // two independently-ticking numbers that only cancel because they were
  // both just sampled from Date.now() a few milliseconds apart — a fragile
  // coincidence, not a guarantee, and it invites rounding drift right at
  // display boundaries. Anchoring to a target instant computed once (and
  // only recomputed when the item's start/pause state actually changes,
  // not on every tick) makes the freeze exact instead of approximate.

  // Only meaningful when state === "done": the item's real logged minutes.
  // Unused by remainingMinutes/projectedFinishTime below (a done item
  // contributes 0 either way, see the comment on remainingMinutes) — carried
  // here purely so lib/routine-timeline.ts can build the timeline
  // visualization from this same per-item resolution instead of a second,
  // separately-maintained one.
  actualMinutes?: number;
  // Only meaningful when state === "pending": a conditional item ("Do you
  // need to shave today?") hasn't been asked yet, so there's no way to know
  // whether it'll actually happen — see RoutineItem.isConditional. Until
  // it's reached and answered (at which point it arrives here as "active",
  // "rest", or the like, same as any other item), it contributes nothing to
  // the estimate rather than assuming its full projectedMinutes will be
  // spent.

// Total minutes of real work still standing between "now" (nowMs) and the
// group being finished.
//
// Done/missed/rest items contribute nothing further: their time already
// happened, and that's already reflected in wherever "now" currently sits.
// Adding their actualMinutes on top of "now" a second time would double-
// count it and push the projection later with every item you finish —
// defeating the point of a projection anchored live to the current moment
// (see "Anchor point" in timer.md: if the user started late, that lateness
// is already baked into "now", not something this math needs to re-derive
// from a session start timestamp).
//
// The active item contributes exactly the time left until its own
// targetInstant, for as long as "now" hasn't reached it yet — a fixed
// quantity that doesn't change tick to tick. The instant "now" reaches (or
// passes) targetInstant, it contributes nothing further: from that point on
// the projection tracks "now" directly, one tick at a time, which is what
// makes it visibly push later for every second you run over. Every other
// pending item (not yet reached, no log at all) contributes its full
// projectedMinutes, untouched — except a conditional one still awaiting its
// "do you need to do this today?" answer, which contributes nothing until
// that's decided (see ItemProjection.isConditional).
